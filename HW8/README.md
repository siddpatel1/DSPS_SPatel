# HW8 
This homework was completed solo.  
All work done by: Siddharth Patel  

### 1:
This homework was about classification and regression models using tree models.
For this, we used randomForest and gradientBoostingtrees for both classification and regression. 
Also plotted confusion matrices to see how well the classification models work for both tree models.
For regression, L2 and L1 functions were used to see how confident we are in regression models.

### 2:
The hardest part of this homework was definitely debugging and understanding how the hyperparameters of the tree models affected the model results.


### 3:
The easiest part of this homework was exploring the data, and reading/implementating information from sklearn documentation.

### 4:
One new thing I learned was how complex these models are, and how the fine tuning of hyperparameters matters a lot for the model results.

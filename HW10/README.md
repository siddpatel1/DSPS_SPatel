# HW10 
This homework was completed solo.  
All work done by: Siddharth Patel  

### 1:
This homework was about Neural Networks and their applications, specifically autoencoders. In this homework we did Digit Recognition and increasing resolution of lower resolution images.

### 2:
The hardest part of this homework was definitely understanding how the layers work. It was easier to understand
the layers for the digit recognition where we are doing classification, but harder for the regression of increasing image resolution.

### 3:
The easiest part of this homework was compiling/running the model, and reading the model summary to get a better idea of what the model is.

### 4:
One new thing I learned was how complicated layers are for neural networks, and it is dependent and different based on what type of problem you are trying to solve.

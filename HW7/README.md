# HW7  
This homework was completed solo.  
All work done by: Siddharth Patel  

### 1:
This homework was about clustering data, this was done through KMeans clustering
and Agglomerative clustering, and how plot these clusterings through TSNE projection plots color-coded by cluster, and dendograms.

### 2:
The hardest part of this homework was definitely debugging and understanding the formulas for calculating intracluster variance and inertias, and then creating functions to do the computations.


### 3:
The easiest part of this homework was plotting the data in various different ways, and reading and implementating information from sklearn and scipy documentation.

### 4:
One new thing I learned was how to process data (whiten), clustering methods (KMeans and Agglomerative), and very surface level math on finding the optimal amount of clusters, given data.

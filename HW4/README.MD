# HW4
This homework was completed solo.  
All work done by: Siddharth Patel  

### 1:
This homework was about working with uncertainties in our data and how they play a role in the overall analysis of the study we are doing.  

### 2:
The hardest part of this homework was figuring out the statistical meaning around the uncertainties and calculations with them, and they still remain a bit unclear.  

### 3:
The easiest part of this homework was the data ingestion, plotting functions and general debugging.

### 4:
One new thing I learned was how to work with errorbar plots and how they are useful in seeing uncertainties. Errorbar plots definitely helped a lot in understanding the statistical analysis we are trying to do.

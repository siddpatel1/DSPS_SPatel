# HW 3

Background Questions: Dakota Neumann   
Data Ingestion: Siddharth Patel  
Data Exploration: Siddharth Patel and Dakota Neumann  
Data Analysis: Collin Davidson and Siddharth Patel  
Final conclusions: Collin Davidson  


1: This homework was about data retrieval and ingestion. As well as how to perform tests on the data to derive results of the experiment we are working on, and understand the results.  

2: The hardest part of this homework was understanding what the processes paper was doing and converting it into code.  

3: The easiest part of this homework was the menial coding, like reading in the .csv file and general debugging.  

4: One new thing I learned how to interpet the data statistically. I did this through the k-s statistic and the p-value, by understanding their statistical definitions in the context of the experiment we are replicating.

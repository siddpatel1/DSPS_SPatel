1) This homework was about working with different types of distributions and how they relate to the central limit theorem and a real world example, in this case the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.  

2) The hardest part of this homework was traversing through Wikipedia to figure out how the Chi-Square formulas worked.  

3) The easiest part of this homework was the plotting of the graphs.  

4) One new thing I learned is that I can use scipy instead of numpy for plotting distributions.

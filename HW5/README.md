# HW5

This homework was completed solo.  
All work done by: Siddharth Patel  

### 1:

This homework was about working with regression techniques, mainly linear regression, 
and plotting data with best-fit lines to find a model 
that closely represents the data.  

### 2:  

The hardest part of this homework was problem 4, where I had to take the derivative of the summation.
This process is not so clear, and I don't quite understand it mathematically.  

### 3:  

The easiest part of this homework was plotting the data and the best-fit lines.  

### 4:

One new thing I learned was the different options I had in matplotlib. 
I really wanted to replicate the plots in the reading, and I think I did so
to a pretty good extent, which was fun to do.
